## ‚å®Ô∏è Welcome

Scyboard is a custom, open-source mechanical keyboard designed for ergonomic comfort and wireless functionality. Inspired by the Sweep and Corne keyboards, scyboard builds on these layouts and design principles. Every aspect was created using open-source tools, making it easy to modify, build, and share.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Compact layout optimized for ergonomics
- ZMK firmware support
- USB-C connectivity & battery charging
- Bluetooth compatible
- Customizable keymaps, layers, and macros
- Layout is declared using Ergogen
- KiCad traces auto-routed using Freerouting
- Open source

## üìä Project Status

Not yet tested!! Scyboard is still in early development, this is an experimental prototype. There may still be bugs or hardware issues.

## üîú TODO

- Build & test prototype
- Test PCB
- Test ZMK firmware
- Review & update README to ensure correctness
- Create a build guide once prototyping and testing is complete
