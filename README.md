## üõ†Ô∏è Build Guide

For assembling the keyboard hardware, I recommend following the guide for the Corne keyboard, as the assembly process is similar. You can find the guide here: [corne-cherry v2 buildguide](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/blob/main/docs/corne-cherry/v2/buildguide_en.md)

In addition, here are some specific notes for the scyboard:
- There will be slight differences in the assembly process due to the different components used, but the overall steps will be similar.
- Place the nice!nano V2 microcontroller face down (flat side facing up).
- Solder the MCU jumper pads on the *same* (top) side of the PCB where the MCU wis mounted.
- Solder the JST battery connector jumpper pads on the *opposite* (back) side of the PCB where the MCU is mounted.

You can use the 3D printed bottom case without a plate. This requires M2x4 screws on the top, M2X3 screws on the bottom, knurled insert nuts, and 3D printed screw spacers. To mount the PCB directly to the case, use the 3D printed screw spacers between the screw and PCB. 

![screw_spacer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef3eff7b-e7f6-42c6-901a-7139196d5e08)
![assembled_case](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5cd95bc-1be1-412f-810b-84f73f5b5ab3)

If you want to add a plate to the build, you can replace the nuts and spacers by using M2x6 standoffs. I included files for a plate if you decide to go this route.
