## ‚å®Ô∏è Welcome

Scyboard is a custom, open-source mechanical keyboard designed for ergonomic comfort and wireless functionality. Inspired by the Sweep and Corne keyboards, scyboard builds on these layouts and design principles. Every aspect was created using open-source tools, making it easy to modify, build, and share.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Compact layout optimized for ergonomics
- ZMK firmware support
- USB-C connectivity & battery charging
- Bluetooth compatible
- Customizable keymaps, layers, and macros
- Layout is declared using Ergogen
- KiCad traces auto-routed using Freerouting
- Open source

## üìä Project Status

The prototype has been built successfully. All aspects of the keyboard and firmware behave as expected. I am working on creating a 3D case for the board.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Guide

For assembling the keyboard hardware, I recommend following the guide for the Corne keyboard, as the assembly process is similar. You can find the guide here: [corne-cherry v2 buildguide](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/blob/main/docs/corne-cherry/v2/buildguide_en.md)

In addition, here are some specific notes for the scyboard:
- There will be slight differences in the assembly process due to the different components used, but the overall steps will be similar.
- Solder the MCU jumper pads on the *opposite* side of the PCB where the MCU wis mounted.
- Solder the JST battery connector jumpper pads on the *same* side of the PCB where the MCU is mounted.

## üíæ Firmware

A ready-to-use ZMK configuration for this hardware is available at:  
[zmk-config-scyboard](https://github.com/Scybin/zmk-config-scyboard)

- Includes keymaps, macros, and custom behaviors tailored for this board.
- Compatible with the [ZMK Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/).
- For firmware details, see the [ZMK Documentation](https://zmk.dev/docs/).

To get started, fork or clone the config and follow the flashing instructions in the ZMK docs.
